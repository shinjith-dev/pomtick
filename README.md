## ❔ What is Pomodoro?

The [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a popular time-management method invented by Italian Francesco Cirillo. This strategy is beneficial if you become distracted while working on a project or want to determine how long a task will take. It's intended to help you focus on tasks and minimize procrastination by dividing work into focused intervals broken by brief pauses. It's perfect for a variety of tasks, including writing, coding, designing, and studying.

- **Work Intervals (Pomodoros)**: You set aside a certain amount of time to focus on a particular activity with few distractions.
- **Short Breaks**: Following each pomodoro, you take a little break to replenish your mind and body. This allows you to stay focused and avoid burnout during lengthy work sessions.

### Benefits of this Technique
- **Improved Focus**: By working in small bursts, you teach your brain to concentrate for long periods.
- **Reduced Procrastination**: Knowing you only have 25 minutes to focus makes it simpler to begin chores that would otherwise appear difficult.
- **Increased Motivation**: Doing pomodoros provides you a sense of success and keeps you going throughout the day.
- **Improved Time Management**: The Pomodoro Technique allows you to arrange your daily and avoid being overwhelmed by enormous activities.

### Traditional Timings:
- **Pomodoro**: 25 minutes
- **Short Break**: 5 minutes
- **Long Break (after 4 pomodoros)**: 15-30 minutes
