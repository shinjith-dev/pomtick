# Pomtick Timer

The [Pomtick Web](https://pomtick.shinjith.dev) is a web implementation of Pomtick pomodoro timer!

## What is Pomodoro?

The [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a popular time-management method invented by Italian Francesco Cirillo. The Pomodoro Technique is useful if you get distracted while working on a project or want to understand how long a task takes. It’s ideal for many types of work including writing, coding, design, and study.

The technique is popular, perhaps because it’s portable and easy to learn. 
- Pick one project or task you want to focus on.
- Set a timer for 25-30 minutes, and get to work.
- When the buzzer sounds, take a two-to-three-minute break.
- Repeat.
- After four sessions, take a longer break.
